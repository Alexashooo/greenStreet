# Green street

Green street is a web application which should serve as a tool for street planning, regardless of whether it is going to be used by
professionals or other people involved in transportation and/or urban planning process. The application is made with Rails and Angular 1, and
it is still in development.

Users can make their own proposals for street profiles by simply dragging, dropping and sorting elements which represents common transport modes or other facilities
that makes a street. The idea is not new but the goal is to make some kind of "localization" for Scandinavian market, with more suitable elements and to
add some extra functionality. The application is gonna a be free for all users.
